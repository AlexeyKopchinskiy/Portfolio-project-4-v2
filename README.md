## Overview

**Coders Sushi Bar** is a full-stack Django web application built as part of the Code Institute Portfolio Project 4. It simulates a modern sushi restaurant platform, offering users a seamless experience to explore the menu, book tables, and manage their profiles ‚Äî all within a clean, responsive interface.

The project is structured around three core Django apps:

- **`booking`**: Handles table reservations, including form submissions, availability logic, and user-specific booking views.
- **`pages`**: Manages static and semi-static content such as the homepage, about page, and menu, providing the public-facing identity of the restaurant.
- **`users`**: Manages user authentication, registration, profile editing, and personalized member areas.

The application is designed with modularity and maintainability in mind. All templates are centralized under a shared `/templates` directory, with subfolders for each app and a unified `base.html` layout that includes navigation, footer, and content blocks. The interface is styled using Bootstrap 5 and enhanced with custom CSS and JavaScript, while rich text editing is supported via Summernote.

Coders Sushi Bar is deployed on Heroku and configured for cloud development via Gitpod. It uses environment variables for secure settings, integrates Google Sheets via `gspread` for optional data export, and supports full password reset flows out of the box.

Whether you're a hungry coder or a curious diner, this project serves up a polished, production-ready experience ‚Äî with no errors, just sushi.

## Agile Methodology

Coders Sushi Bar was developed using a structured Agile approach, emphasizing iterative delivery, stakeholder alignment, and continuous improvement. The project was divided into five weekly milestones, each functioning as a sprint with clearly defined deliverables and review checkpoints. Development was guided by a comprehensive set of user stories and grouped into strategic **epics**, ensuring that every feature served a real user need and contributed to the overall system architecture.

# Booking System for Restaurants

## üè° About the Project
A web application allowing users to manage restaurant bookings effortlessly. Users can create, update, and delete their reservations while accessing personalized booking history.^

## üîó Live Demo  
Try the live version here: [Live Demo](https://portfolio-project-4-1f0987e45403.herokuapp.com/)  

## üì∑ Screenshots  
Here are some previews of the app in action:

**Start page**

## üöÄ Features
- Secure **user authentication**.
- **User-specific** booking history.
- Seamless **reservation management** (create, update, delete).
- Intuitive **admin panel** for restaurant staff.
- Administrator interface

This project uses a custom Django model architecture to handle restaurant bookings with flexibility, accessibility, and administrative clarity in mind.

## üìò Models

**BookingStatus**
Represents the current state of a reservation (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled).
| Field | Type | Description | 
| status | CharField | Unique name for the status | 


**Location**
Defines different seating areas in the restaurant, such as ‚ÄúTerrace‚Äù or ‚ÄúWindow Booth‚Äù.
| Field | Type | Description | 
| location | CharField | Name of the area | 


**Table**
Each table is a reservable unit, assigned to a Location. Tables are annotated with features for better matching.
| Field | Type | Description | 
| size | SmallInteger | Number of seats | 
| smoking | Boolean | Whether smoking is allowed | 
| accessible | Boolean | If the table accommodates accessibility needs | 
| location | ForeignKey | Linked to Location | 


**Reservation**
Captures each booking made by a user, including time, table, guest count, and preferences.
| Field | Type | Description |
