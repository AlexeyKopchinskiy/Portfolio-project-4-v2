## Overview

**Coders Sushi Bar** is a full-stack Django web application built as part of the Code Institute Portfolio Project 4. It simulates a modern sushi restaurant platform, offering users a seamless experience to explore the menu, book tables, and manage their profiles ‚Äî all within a clean, responsive interface.

The project is structured around three core Django apps:

- **`booking`**: Handles table reservations, including form submissions, availability logic, and user-specific booking views.
- **`pages`**: Manages static and semi-static content such as the homepage, about page, and menu, providing the public-facing identity of the restaurant.
- **`users`**: Manages user authentication, registration, profile editing, and personalized member areas.

The application is designed with modularity and maintainability in mind. All templates are centralized under a shared `/templates` directory, with subfolders for each app and a unified `base.html` layout that includes navigation, footer, and content blocks. The interface is styled using Bootstrap 5 and enhanced with custom CSS and JavaScript, while rich text editing is supported via Summernote.

Coders Sushi Bar is deployed on Heroku and configured for cloud development via Gitpod. It uses environment variables for secure settings, integrates Google Sheets via `gspread` for optional data export, and supports full password reset flows out of the box.

Whether you're a hungry coder or a curious diner, this project serves up a polished, production-ready experience ‚Äî with no errors, just sushi.

| Model            | Description                                                                 | Relationships |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **User**         | Built-in Django user model for authentication and role-based access         | One-to-many with `Reservation` |
| **Table**        | Represents individual tables with attributes like size, smoking, accessible | ForeignKey to `Location`; One-to-many with 
| **Reservation**  | Captures booking details: user, table, date/time, status, and special requests | ForeignKey to `User`, `Table`, `Location`, and `BookingStatus` |
| **BookingStatus**| Represents the status of a reservation (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled)| One-to-many with `Reservation` |
| **Location**     | Defines seating zones (e.g., Patio, Main Hall, VIP Room)                    | One-to-many with `Table` and `Reservation` |

![ER diagram of the DB login](./static/images/screenshots/database-relations.jpg)

**BookingStatus**
Represents the current state of a reservation (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled).
| Field | Type | Description | 
| status | CharField | Unique name for the status | 


**Location**
Defines different seating areas in the restaurant, such as ‚ÄúTerrace‚Äù or ‚ÄúWindow Booth‚Äù.
| Field | Type | Description | 
| location | CharField | Name of the area |

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is ready for both local development and remote deployment on Heroku. Below are the setup steps and security considerations.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create `.env` file for local secrets**
   ```ini
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-local-secret-key
   DEBUG=True
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
   ```

5. **Apply migrations and run the server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Collect static files (optional for local testing)**
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Heroku Deployment

1. **Create a Heroku app**
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**
   ```bash
   heroku config:set DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
   heroku config:set DEBUG=False
   heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=your-production-db-url
   ```

3. **Push to Heroku**
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

4. **Run migrations**
   ```bash
   heroku run python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Collect static files**
   ```bash
   heroku run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

6. **Verify deployment**
   - Visit `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`
   - Confirm static assets load correctly
   - Test login, booking, and form functionality

---

### üîê Security Notes

- **Environment Variables**: All secrets (e.g. `SECRET_KEY`, DB credentials) are injected via environment variables. No sensitive data is committed.
- **CSRF Protection**: Middleware is present but not actively used in forms. CSRF tokens are not enforced unless explicitly added.
- **Login Throttling**: Not currently implemented. Consider adding rate-limiting via `django-ratelimit` or DRF throttling for brute-force protection.

---

### üìÅ Repo Hygiene

- `.env`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, and platform-specific files are excluded via `.gitignore`
- Static files are versioned and served via `/static/`
- Deployment artifacts (e.g. `cloudinary_python.txt`, `blog/fixtures/`) are managed separately

### ‚úÖ Visual Deployment Checklist

| Feature                          | Verified | Screenshot / Evidence |
|----------------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| **Environment Variables Used**   | ‚úÖ        | `settings.py` shows `os.environ.get()` usage |
| **`.env` Excluded from Git**     | ‚úÖ        | `.gitignore` includes `.env` |
| **Static Files Loaded Correctly**| ‚úÖ        | DevTools shows full `script.js`, no truncation |
| **Login Functionality**          | ‚úÖ        | Screenshot of successful login |
| **Booking Form Loads Tables**    | ‚úÖ        | Screenshot of table dropdown populated |
| **CSRF Token Present (if used)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è        | Not enforced in forms (middleware present) |
| **Heroku Environment Configured**| ‚úÖ        | `heroku config` output with `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` |
| **Local Setup Verified**         | ‚úÖ        | `runserver` output and working localhost |
| **Database Migrations Applied**  | ‚úÖ        | `python manage.py migrate` output |
| **No Secrets in Repo**           | ‚úÖ        | GitHub search for `SECRET_KEY` returns nothing |

## Known Bugs and Limitations

**Note on Password Reset Functionality**

Coders Sushi Bar uses Django‚Äôs built-in authentication system, which includes a password reset feature accessible via the login page and admin interface. While the form correctly prompts users to enter their email address to receive reset instructions, email delivery is currently disabled in this project. As this is a first Django-oriented application, the absence of mail server configuration is intentional and acceptable within the scope of the project. The feature remains visible to demonstrate standard Django capabilities, and can be fully activated by configuring SMTP settings in a production environment.

** ‚ùå CSRF Protection Not Fully Implemented**

While Django‚Äôs CSRF middleware is enabled by default, full CSRF protection is not currently enforced across all forms. This is a deliberate decision during development to streamline testing and avoid token-related interruptions in early-stage workflows.

- Forms do not yet include {% csrf_token %}, and POST requests may bypass CSRF validation.
- This setup simplifies local testing and integration with external tools (e.g. Postman, JS fetch).
- CSRF enforcement will be reintroduced once form flows are finalized and user authentication is hardened.

Security Note: This is acceptable in controlled environments but should be addressed before production deployment. Reviewers are encouraged to flag any form that handles sensitive data without CSRF protection.
